      <h3>Prunelart - Cazottes - 16,00 €</h3>
      <p>Prunelart (Prunelard) is a grape variety native to the Gaillac region of south-western France (Tarn). It is described as the father of the Cot and Malbec varieties. The area planted with this grape variety is around 14 hectares worldwide. That's why we're so proud to be part of this very special little production.</p>
      <p>Our 2019 Prunelart</p>
      <p>The grapes were hand-picked in mid-September. Destemmed and left to ferment in a fibre tank. Maceration on the skins for just 3 days before pressing, then fermentation and the malolactic process are completed in the vat. The first racking takes place in February. Bottling in May 2020.</p>
      <p>Prunelart has an intense red colour and aromas of morello cherry and spices. Ideal at a temperature of 14°C when young, and around 18°C after a year's ageing in bottle.</p>

        <h3>Rackham 2021 - Cazottes - 15,00 €</h3>
          <p>Rackham is made from the Jurancon Noir grape variety. Originally from south-west France, it is genetically similar to Folle Blanche (in fact, Jurancon Noir is sometimes called Folle Noire) and Cot.</p>
          <p>Our Rackham 2021</p>
          <p>Hand-picked, 24-hour maceration on skins in a concrete vat. We separated the free-run juice and the pressed juice - they were blended a few weeks before bottling. Racked only before bottling.</p>
          <p>Light red colour, aromas of forest fruits and cherry.</p>
          <p>Served slightly chilled, this is the perfect wine to accompany beef carpaccio or, why not, grilled fish.</p>
